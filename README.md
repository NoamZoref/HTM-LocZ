## Overview
**HTM-LocZ** provides tools for analysis of spheroid–fibroblast interactions imaged using PSF-engineered high-throughput microscopy (HTM) using Depth-from-Defocus (DfD) based z-localizations.

## Repository Structure
```
functions/         # core functions (DfD, localization, crop)
data/input/        # example input data 
data/output/       # output data generated by spheroid_fibroblast_3d_localizations.ipynb
```

The notebook ['spheroid_fibroblast_3d_localizations.ipynb'](spheroid_fibroblast_3d_localizations.ipynb) provides an example demonstrating how the functions are used for 3D analysis of raw spheroid–fibroblast imaging data.
